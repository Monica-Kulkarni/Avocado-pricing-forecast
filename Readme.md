**My inspiration for this project:**

This was my venture in R, I wanted to learn more about all the data visualization libraries. 
Since R is a statistical programming language, I next took on pattern recognition and time-series forecasting using ARIMA in this project. 
I came to know about how predictive analytics can be applied to a time-series data structure depending on seasonal patterns.
In this project, I've created several visualizations and used ARIMA forecasting to predict prices of avocado in the coming two years.
